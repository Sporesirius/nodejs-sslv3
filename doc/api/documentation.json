The feature may emit warnings. Backward\ncompatibility is not guaranteed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- separator -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stability: 1 - Experimental. The feature is not subject to Semantic Versioning\nrules. Non-backward compatible changes or removal may occur in any future\nrelease. Use of the feature is not recommended in production environments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- separator -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stability: 2 - Stable. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem is a high\npriority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Use caution when making use of Experimental features, particularly within\nmodules. End users may not be aware that experimental features are being used.\nBugs or behavior changes may surprise end users when Experimental API\nmodifications occur. To avoid surprises, use of an Experimental feature may need\na command-line flag. Experimental features may also emit a <a href=\"process.html#process_event_warning\">warning</a>.</p>"
